# Spiegel AI Remote

Remote control application for Spiegel AI

This application wirelessly connects to the smart mirror and allows for the user to customize it.

This project is cross plattform and will support android and iOS devices. Web- and desktop versions of this app might not be fully supported if the wireless connection should turn out to be a hassle to implement or to maintain.

## Functionality

### Login

The user can log in by creating an account or by signing in with a service such as google or apple. This allows syncing of devices. The log in can also be skipped, but the user will be warned about the limited functionality.

### Profiles

The user can create multiple profiles, which allows multiple people to use the mirror (not simultaneously). These profiles are saved to their account or locally if no account was created.

### Customization

Each Profile has its own customization profile(s). Customization profiles consist of widgets and personalization options such as color schemes and positioning. They can either be manually selected by the user or automatically set up to change after certain events such as time or sunset.

### Widgets

Widgets are little windows the user can choose to show on the mirror's screen. Each one can be selected and positioned within a customization profile. Some examples are weather reports, calendars, horoscopes (lol), notes, quotes.

### Others

There is more functionality, obviously, but these will be essential to have a well working remote control for the smartes mirror in the market.
